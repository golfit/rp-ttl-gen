# rp-ttl-gen
Red Pitaya TTL generator (i.e. bringing the Jorway 221 to the 21st century).

This project is built in Vivado 17.4 (WebPack).  It's developed using a Red Pitaya StemLab 125-14 device with Xilinx Zynq 7010 FPGA.  The application goal is to output a picket-fence digital signal with gate times recovered from memory.  The device should have an init, armed, triggered, and complete phases.
